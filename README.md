# DS4003 Dashboard
## Dashboard Description
This dashboard is meant to track carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions based on the year selected by the user. It enables those to look at totals and per capita emissions for each country,
the type of greenhouse gas emission, and how each type of emission has looked over time. This dashboard is meant for those who are curious about the world's greenhouse gas emissions
based on our ongoing climate crisis, which is also my motivtion for building it. There is no specific age or condition requirement to understand it; it is meant to be a quick resource for those wanting to know more about carbon dioxide emissions.

## Dashboard Building Process
The dashboard building process first started with the graphs and charts. I did pivot from my original layout ideas, but only because the UI items, charts and colors present in my dashboard currently, were best suited for my data. The dashboard currently contains a chloroplinth map, stacked area chart, and grouped bar chart. To provide more information, I added a radio item that interacted with the chloroplinth map to display the per capita or total for each country. The stacked area chart showed each CO2 type contribution overtime, up until the chosen year from the drop down. The last graph, the grouped bar chart shows the top ten countries for the year, along with the most contributing CO2 types for that specific country. As for color scheme and layout, I opted for darker colors that were easy on the eyes and structures the dashboard from wide to narrow (more broad information to more specific analyses). Although the data cleaning and building process was difficult at times, I do believe this dashboard highlights my perserverance to finish a project that is relevant to the times and to all of us.
